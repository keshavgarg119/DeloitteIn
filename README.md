**TASK 1**

#**Here is the background information on your task**

We have signed a new account: Daikibo Industrials, a global leader in the manufacturing of heavy machinery, founded and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. They needed assistance with a variety of problems and were impressed to find out Deloitte could help in all verticals.
Daikibo is in the process of integrating IIoT (industrial internet of things) devices to monitor, measure and analyse their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half in another. They need your help to combine the two.


#**Here is your task**

Take the following steps to complete the task:
1. Create an account at repl.it.
2. Fork this project into your workspace.(Link: https://replit.com/@NikolayTsenkov/Task1)
3. After navigating to the project, find the Fork button on the page and press it.
4. Get acquainted with the 2 data formats by exploring the files (hint: it's the same message, represented in 2 different formats):
data-1.json
data-2.json
5. Explore the target unified format by looking at the file data-result.json. This is the format you should aim to output in your solution.
6. Complete the solution located in the file main.py.
7. The project is set up in a way to test your solution automatically as you run it.

Find the 2 functions in need of implementation and finish them (look for comment lines starting with "IMPLEMENT:").
Use repl.it to run your project and test your solution (look for a big Run button, currently located at the top).
Don't mind the red colour of the console output and the message on failed repl process when you run the project - the important thing is to see no failures in the tests.
Please use comments in main.py, if you need to leave notes on your solution.

(Hint: notice the timestamps of the 2 telemetry formats are different, but the target format is exactly like one of them (milliseconds). You will need to convert the other format (ISO) to it. Check the resources for a link to a SO post that can help.)




**TASK 2**

Write a short, formal and informative development proposal for the following project:

Private dashboard showing the health status of the 9 machines in each of Daikibo's 4 factories for which they collect telemetry.
Access to the page happens only within the client's intranet.
Authentication is synced to an internal authentication server (users can leverage their company-wide accounts).
The dashboard consists of a single page listing the current status of all monitored devices.
The view is collapsible/expandable at the factory and device levels (showing a history of statuses). 
What to include (please take a look at the document template):

Overview
An intro to the proposal and a high-level description of the project
Scope
Describe the functionality of the project
Reference the graphics included in the template
Estimate
A total man-hour estimate + breakdown for development, testing, and integration
Timeline
List the milestones of the project
Support
Let the client know they can rely on continuous product support (e.g. bug fixes, support tickets, new functionality)
For this task, you will need some word-processing software. MS Office works if you have that, but you can also use free software like Libre Office (find a link in the Resources). Please find a template for your proposal document in the Resources. It is a good idea to keep the document as long as it is in the template (in terms of the number of pages)
